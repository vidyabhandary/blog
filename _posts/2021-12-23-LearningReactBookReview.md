### Book Review - Learning React - 2nd Edition by Alex Banks and Eve Porcello

I enjoyed learning from this book but overall I got the feeling that the authors lost steam towards the end and were trying to complete the book in a hurry before the deadline.

The 2nd chapter in this book that deals with the part of Javascript one needs to know for learning React is extremely good.

**Pros**

1. Based on latest React framework
2. Very well explained Javascript basics chapter
3. Covers all major part of learning React Framework
4. Hooks explained very well
5. _Suspense_ which is still experimental has been addressed
6. Code examples are very good

**Cons**

1. Would have preferred incremental single project approach. To some extent this has been addressed but not completely
2. Many files are missing in the github repo - Socket.io example, GraphQL files, Chapter 10 files etc.
3. Code examples should always mention which file they are referring to in github

**Overall**

A very good book to learn fundamentals of React Stat management and Hooks. It can be a supplement to other streams of learning not a single source of learning.
