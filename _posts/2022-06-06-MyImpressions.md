### I believe one of the signs of a great session is when you find yourself ruminating over what you have heard from the speaker.

[Lean2LeadPune](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lean2lead-pune-bbb92a169/) organized a live session with [Nancy Katyal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nancykatyal). The topic was "Becoming a Speaking Superstar".

This was my experience and following are _some_ of the key inspiring ideas -

**The 2 key ideas that resonated most with me -**

**1. Don't compare your day 6 with someone who is at day 600.**

**2. Image matters even when you are with yourself - consider how you behave with someone you want to impress vs when you are alone.**

**The question is why do you behave as if your image does not matter to yourself ?**

#### 1. When preparing for a speech consider the following

- Audience
- Structure
- Delivery

#### 2. Audience

- Focus on contribution instead of criticism. This will reduce your fear of audience.
- Consider how the audience could think differently, could feel differently, and do differently after your speech.
- Always consider what is in it for the audience, why should they listen to you ?
- What is your call to action in the speech ? What will the audience take as something to implement ?
- When you are persuading, people will change for their reasons not yours.
- A story sparks curiosity and can be used to convey the truth. It is a much better medium than unadorned truth.

#### 3. Own your light

- Everyone has something to contribute.
- Do not underestimate the effect of your small contributions.
- The greatest speakers all shine in their own light.
- You will never get credit for something that nobody knows about and nobody can recommend what they don't know.
- Show your competence.

#### 4. On your progress

- Good is better than perfect.
- Don't compare your day 6 with someone who is at day 600.

#### 5. Image and Body Language

- Image matters even when you are with yourself - consider how you behave with someone you want to impress vs when you are alone. The question is why do you behave as if your image does not matter to yourself ?
- Use your hands and match them with what you speak.
- When trying to gauge if the audience is engaged, look for a cluster of gestures not a single gesture or cue.

#### 6. When you are interrupted

- Don't give conversational strokes when you are interrupted
- Balance warmth with competence

**All in all - A very informative and motivating session**

Some additional notes

- Triggers for anything that happens are inside, not outside of your self.
- Changed meaning of triggers lead to changed triggers.
- Ensure that in the name of contributing you are not criticizing.
- Be comfortable in your own skin, if you want people to have skin in the game; you need to have your own skin in the game.
- People are hungry for appreciation. They want to feel they matter.
- Done is better than perfect.
- Shift nervousness to excited
- If you say to youself that you are excited, you can trick your brain to anticipate talking to people.
- People don't want you to fail, your audience is silently cheering you up.
- Keep some space between your arms and body. Otherwise one looks very stiff.
- Use listing in your speech.
- Posture is imporant, roll your shoulders back.
- Good speakers have conviction when they speak.
- Power words
  - Interesting,
  - Investment (don't say 'Fee for this')
  - Imagine - how it can benefit your company
  - Critical
- 'It depends' is powerful too but be careful of content when using power words.
- When colleague interrupt

  - Balance warmth with competence
  - Dont give conversational strokes when someone interrupts
  - Dont give any type of acknowledgements
  - May be you can share your idea first ( 30 sec, 1 min etc )
  - Say - I might be digressing - this is a critical point
  - I didn't get an opportunity to speak, can I make my point at the end of the meeting

- Tell people what is in it for them - profit or loss

- Ask a question - with your show of hands, tell me something etc
  - With this information you can tailor your presentation accordingly
