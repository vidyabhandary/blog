### Book Review — Things to make and do in the fourth dimension

Math is stranger than fiction and this book is filled with the many curiosities of the math world. It contains a glimpse into its intriguing lanes in an entertaining manner along with optional hands-on activities to enjoy.

Each chapter is not so much in depth that it is akin to a text book but just enough to get you started to play with the math, if the topic interests you. 
Dive in - you'll be amazed at the sights (with a little math humor thrown in). 

I won't claim to have understood it all. 

For e.g.
The multidimensional world which was just too bizarre. 
*(A helpful tip by Geoffrey Hinton -  "To deal with hyper-planes in a 14-dimensional space, visualize a 3-D space and say “fourteen” to yourself very loudly. Everyone does it.")*

But there is something in it for everybody.

Some delightful snippets - 

- **Different-sized infinities**
- **The strange cut outs from Mobius loops**
- **Prime numbers ( considered pointless math till 1940 !! )**
- **A sphere that increases in size even when bounded by other packing spheres (26th dimension onwards) !! Weird is an understatement !**
- **Ramanujan summation where sum of all the positive whole numbers = -1/12 ! Used in string theory ( I am still trying to wrap my head around this).**
- **Knot theory - Trying to find one method to know if a tangled string is a knot and if so how to undo it with minimal effort. Why bother ? Biologists may be able to devise new wave of medical treatments based on this.**
- **Uncomputable numbers !!!!! ( No amount of exclamations will do this justice ! )**
- **Description of Godel's incompleteness theorem. Short, succinct and intuitive.**
- **Riemann Hypothesis, e, π, Φ, infinite hotel do get a mention (almost de rigeur I think).**

### An engaging book about math; The language the universe speaks to us in. Fall into the fascination and there's no going back.
