**AI Agents Are Cool... But Let’s Not Jump Into the Deep End First 🏊‍♂️**

So I was explaining to someone recently how building with LLMs doesn’t always mean creating full-blown AI agents. You know what I mean - those systems where the AI decides what tools to use, when to use them, and orchestrates workflows all by itself.

It felt great to share a high-level, intuitive view of why starting with agents is often the wrong move. And guess what? Anthropic’s piece 
[Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents)
and High Growth Engineers post 
[Stop Building Agents](https://read.highgrowthengineer.com/p/stop-building-ai-agents-heres-what-to-do-instead) 
articulate these thoughts beautifully.

💡 **TL;DR**

**Agents are like the Lamborghinis of AI—they look flashy and powerful, but they’re not always practical for the daily commute.** In most cases, especially early on, you're better off with simpler, more predictable patterns:

- **Prompt Chaining:** When tasks flow in sequence.
- **Routing:** For directing different inputs to the right handler.
- **Orchestrator-Worker:** When big tasks need dynamic subtasks.
- **Evaluator-Optimizer:** For polishing outputs until they shine.
- **Parallelization:** To speed things up when calls don’t depend on each other.

🤖 **When to Actually Use Agents?**

Only when your workflow is too **unpredictable** or **creative** for predefined steps—like in data exploration, ideation, or code refactoring with human oversight.

🚫 And please... **don’t use agents high-stakes decisions especially in Financial Transactions. That’s asking for chaos.**

This isn’t about stifling innovation—it’s about using the right tool for the job and avoiding unnecessary complexity. Especially if you're just getting started, simplicity wins.
