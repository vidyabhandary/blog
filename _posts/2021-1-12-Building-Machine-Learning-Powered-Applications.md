# Book Review - Building Machine Learning Powered Applications by Emmanuel Ameisen

I found this book a bit frustrating to follow. 

Wherever the code is in shown the book and a link provided - it is to the main github repo and not to the individual jupyter notebook or python code. Nor was the filename mentioned beneath the code snippet.

Not a deal breaker but it is *frustrating.*

## Pros 

- ### Covers a lot of theory on building a machine learning application
- ### You build a ML Editor that gives recommendations 
- ### Important concepts are illustrated in specific notebooks
- ###  Incremental changes to the model for better results

## Cons

- ###  More theory, less code
- ###  Light on deployment details
- ###  Book links point only to the main repo and not the specific file with the code 
- ###  Not all tied together (filter models / tests). 

[My github repo](https://github.com/vidyabhandary/BuildML) - It contains the chapter numbers in the filenames.
