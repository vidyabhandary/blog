![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vidyabhandary/blog/master/images/GitHub150Days2022.PNG)

**The Craze Continues #150DaysOfCode Challenge**

**Just continuing ....**

Am doing nothing special other than just continuing the streak.
Still - It is a milestone I never thought I would ever reach.

Looking to continuing this as long as I can but don't expect to reach 200. Why ?
Bcoz life happens for the best of reasons and that can cause a break in a routine !!

Very very happy to have reached this far.

**Overall**

0. Core Python - Continued
1. Workato 3 Automation Pro certification

**Lessons Learnt**

_Pros_

- Just have fun and don't break the streak if you don't have to
- No fatigue since this time I gave myself permission to stop when I needed, I had nothing more to prove (to myself)
- Always cool to see the towers in the 3D/VR rendition -

_Cons_

- None really
