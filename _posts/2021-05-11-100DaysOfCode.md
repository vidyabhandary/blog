### 100 Days Of Code Github Wall

**My experience with the #100DaysOfCode Challenge**
**Motivation**

I decided to try the #100DaysOfCode Challenge for a couple of reasons. 
First, to see how I would manage this and secondly to complete items that were languishing due to low motivation.

I did not tweet daily as is generally recommended. For me the public motivation / goal does not appeal. 
I also decided to finish my incomplete items first. And only then start anything new.

**Code Complete**

1. Started and Completed - *'Data Cleaning Cookbook'* by Michael Walker
2. Completed - *'Automate the boring stuff'* by AI Sweigart 
3. Python course in Udemy
4. 100+ Python Exercises 

**Other**

Strictly does not fall into the coding challenge but I thought it relevant all the same.
1. Completed Google Cloud Sprint course in Coursera 
2. LinkedIn Assessments - 4

**Lessons Learnt**

*Pros*

- Definitely works. Nothing like not wanting to miss the streak in the github profile as motivation !
- Was able to complete every item that had just been pending for no reason other than low motivation
- A very good experience, gives a confidence boost along with a sense of accomplishment
- If do-not-break-the-streak or chain works for you, this challenge is highly recommended

*Cons*

- I believe in complete digital detoxification for one day during the week / fortnight. Obviously, this could not happen with the #100DaysOfCode challenge
- Very easy to just go through the motions if fatigued
