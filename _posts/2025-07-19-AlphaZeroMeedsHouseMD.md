### AlphaGo Zero meets House M.D.

Imagine a world where AlphaGo meets House, M.D. — a place where AI doctors evolve through realistic medical battles in a virtual hospital , treating thousands of simulated patients until they become diagnostic virtuosos.

**Welcome to Agent Hospital** - where patients, nurses, and doctors are all AI agents — powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) — **interacting, diagnosing, treating, and most importantly: learning**

🩺 Here’s how it works:

 • Every agent — patient, nurse, doctor — is autonomous.
 • There is a **multi-agent collaboration** between patients, nurses, and doctors to simulate the full clinical workflow:
 **Triage → Consultation → Diagnosis → Treatment → Follow-Up**
 • And they evolve through experience — not labeled data — by treating thousands of virtual patients in a closed-loop environment.

🧬 The secret? **SEAL — Simulacrum-based Evolutionary Agent Learning**

 • AI doctors learn from real outcomes — recovery or relapse, with a memory system that is a combination of case base + experience base.
 • Patient agents are generated autonomously using LLMs + medical knowledge
 • No manual annotation. No human-in-the-loop. Just AI learning by doing and reflecting.

It is **AlphaGo Zero for medicine**; instead of playing millions of Go games against itself, here the AI Agents in the simulacrum are diagnosing diseases.

🎯 And the results?
 • After treating tens of thousands of virtual patients , these evolved doctor agents outperformed state-of-the-art medical AI models on the MedQA benchmark — a set of real-world USMLE-style medical questions.
 • Their skills transferred to the real world — acing real medical exams after only virtual practice.
 • It’s like training a pilot in a flight simulator — and watching them nail their first solo flight.

🌍 But this is bigger than medicine.
**Agent Hospital is a blueprint for evolving AI agents in any complex domain — law, education, finance, and beyond.**
