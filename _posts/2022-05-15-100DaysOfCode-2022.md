### 100 Days Of Code Github Wall - 2022

**My second experience with the #100DaysOfCode Challenge**

**Motivation**

I did not start out thinking I would do this challenge again but when I realized I was practicing my skills on a daily basis it just made sense to continue.

I also noticed that the challenge has ended at the same month as my first experience with the #100DaysOfCode Challenge.

**I wonder if this affliction is going to hit me every year around the same time ?**

No public tweets or public posts this time round either. I am self-motivated enough and don't really need public accountability.

I am not where I wanted to be after this challenge but I am still proud of my progress.

Will continue to practice. Let's see how that goes. Not going to do it as a part of another #100DaysOfCode Challenge for now though.

**Overall**

0. Core Python
1. Workato 1 and Workato 2 Automation Pro certifications
2. Pragmatic System Design - Udemy Course
3. Software Architecture Case Studies - Udemy Course
4. LinkedIn Assessment - 1

**Lessons Learnt**

_Pros_

- This time it was easier to keep the streak going.

- Cool to see the towers in the 3D/VR rendition -

- It is always amazing to note that one CAN complete the challenge difficult though it may seems in places.

_Cons_

- Like last time - I believe in complete digital detoxification for one day during the week / fortnight. Obviously, this could not happen with the #100DaysOfCode challenge

- Lesser Fatigue - I think until the last 10 days of the challenge I did not feel like I was waiting for the end.
