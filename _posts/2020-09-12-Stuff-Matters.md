### Book Review — Stuff Matters: Exploring the Marvelous Materials That Shape Our Man-Made World by Mark Miodownik

Concrete cloth, Self-cleaning concrete, Chocolate Engineering, Materials that change behavior completely with just addition of one more layer of atoms, Material that is 99.8% air (Blurs around edges when viewed. The author equates it to holding a piece of sky !).

This is a effervescent romp through common materials that surround the author as he sits on his deck drinking coffee.
Most chapters read like a story going through the history of the material, chemical composition, structure and its relevance to our everyday life. (No chemical equations if this makes a difference).

**It brings to home, an appreciation of the fact that the structure of the bonds inside a material matters just as much as the composition.**

Can’t wait to read '__Liquid__' by the same author.
