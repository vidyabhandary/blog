### Book Review â€” Grokking Algorithms by Aditya Bhargava

The word *'grokking'* refers to *'understand (something) intuitively or by empathy'* and it is the intuition part that this book attempts to impart via some really 
awesome illustrations.

First off - this is not a book for people who have completed Computer Science or have learnt algorithms. However it IS a wonderful book 
for beginners or as is mentioned on the cover *'for curious people'*.

The chapter on dynamic programming alone makes this book highly worth reading. 

### Pros -

- #### Very easy to understand and grasp the underlying intuition 
- #### Everyday relatable examples of the algorithm usage
- #### The high quality illustrations 
- #### Written in a fun and engaging manner so easy to dive in and keep reading
- #### Chapters are independent, so can pick without needing to read in sequence 

### Cons -

- #### Minimal algorithms covered and in less depth
- #### Not a substitute for the more formal books in this area
- #### Will not help you master algorithms. This book is to start the journey into algorithms
