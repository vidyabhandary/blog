## Book Review - Secret Pulse of Time by Stefan Klein

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vidyabhandary/blog/refs/heads/master/images/time.jpg)

I picked up this book because I wanted the answer to this question -

- Why does life go by faster and faster as we grow older?

None of the material I had absorbed on this topic seemed incomplete and were not satisfactory.
My search though has ended with reading this book. I guess I needed something that would meander through biology, physics, neuroscience and philosophy along with practical wisdom.

#### **Key Themes and Insights**

- **Perception Shapes Time**  
  Time is not an absolute entity; rather, our experience of it is deeply influenced by our attention, emotions, and consciousness.

  - **Heightened awareness** and engaging deeply with the present moment can make time feel richer and more expansive.
  - Conversely, monotony and routine can shrink time in retrospect, making even long periods seem fleeting.

- **Biological Clocks and Inner Time**

  - Each of us operates on an internal biological clock, which may differ subtly from person to person.
  - Inner time is distinct from mechanical and biological clocks, as it is shaped by the focus of our consciousness.

- **The Vicious Cycle of Stress and Time Pressure**

  - Stress and the perception of "not enough time" are self-reinforcing. A lack of control over our schedules can create a feedback loop of anxiety, which leads to undermining our ability to manage tasks effectively.
  - Feeling in control of time, however, mitigates this stress and enhances our sense of well-being.

- **Attention and Distraction**

  - Our ability to concentrate is a cornerstone of how we experience time. Distractions and an overload of stimuli fragment our attention, making us feel like time is slipping away.
  - Writing down intrusive thoughts and returning to tasks can help maintain focus and regain control.

- **Memory and Timeâ€™s Passage**

  - Time feels slower in youth because the brain commits more impressions to memory. As we age and experiences become repetitive, fewer memories are stored, making time appear to accelerate.
  - New experiences and challenges enrich memory and can slow the subjective passage of time, even in later life.

- **Practical Strategies for Mastering Time**  
  Klein offers practical advice to alter our relationship with time:
  - Reward yourself for achieving intermediate goals to sustain motivation.
  - Train your attentiveness to stay present, savoring the small moments of life.
  - Incorporate activities like tai chi or rhythmic breathing to recalibrate your perception of time.
  - Use memory aids such as journals and photographs to enrich and preserve meaningful experiences.

#### **Final Thoughts**

Time is as much a construct of our inner world as it is an external measure.
**View time not as a resource to be managed but as an aspect of existence to be savored.**
