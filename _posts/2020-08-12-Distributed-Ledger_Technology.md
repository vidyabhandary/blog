### Distributed Ledger Technology: The Science of the Blockchain by Roger Wattenhofer

This book was a mind bender !! This book so far is the book for which I had to google the most. 

I watched quite a few videos to follow the theorems and proofs. I am not entirely sure I grasped all the ideas in the book though. My rate of digesting the material was not as fast as I would have liked it.

This is no introductory book and I think the real audience is probably math and computer science master/doctoral students. It is a deep dive (sink or swim) into distributed systems technologies and the mathematical underpinnings for the same. In fact the 2nd heading should read - "The Math of the Blockchain" and not "Science of the Blockchain"

**On a very broad perspective I like the lead up in the chapters from Paxos to Distributed storage. It got me thinking about the math behind decentralized systems with the requirements of integrity, consistency and availability.** (Kind of take these things for granted when making an ATM withdrawal !)

Read if working/studying in this technology space. This is more of a study/text book.
