# Learn Git in a Month of Lunches - Rick Umali

There are many books that teach Git and many online courses along with blog posts too.
But I had been looking for a good book that would go into the fundamentals without making it very complex. Plus I did not have a lot of time each day to work on this. 

The lessons in this book are in easy byte-sized chunks which worked out perfectly.

Actually the entire 'Month of lunches' series is organized around this concept. (Yet to read the other books).

One understands the basic git and git commands from groud up. Hands on via both git bash and git gui.
A good read. And I was able to learn git in time to contribute to a Summer of Code project.
