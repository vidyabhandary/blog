## Book Review - Designing Data Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann

### A tech book that sparks joy !

I personally don't think a mere review of this book can do it any kind of justice given the sheer breadth of the topics it covers along with the in-depth technical details.

This book is a treasure trove of information, exploring complex concepts like distributed data storage, distributed transactions, challenges in replication, partitioning, consistency, batch processing, stream processing, concurrency, stale reads, database internals, B-trees,
LSTM (the best explanation I have found so far), concurrent writes and handling conflict resolution, RAFT, Paxos, Avro, Thrift and Protocol Buffers, Byzantine Generals Problem,
maintaining order of events with network failures and clock skew, consistent prefix reads, Elasticsearch with document-partitioned indexes and the list is seemingly endless !!!

I do consider that it has a steep learning/understanding curve and I am not even going to pretend that I truly profess to have complete understanding of all chapters.

Having said that I am eagerly anticipating the next edition of the book coming in Dec 2025 by O'Reilly Media!!!

This book's foundational knowledge has caused the launch of a few thousand blogs/YouTube channels that have dissected every chapter of the book in depth.

Its core strength is that it is has a technology-agnostic approach when explaining concepts.

Each chapter begins with a clear definition of the concept, then comes the unravelling of its complexities one by one, much like a suspenseful mystery which disassembles the plot.

By the end of the chapter, you grasp the nuanced details that underpin each sanguine definition. A superb handling of the topic in the hands of an expert.

Reading the papers listed at the end of each chapter would have made finishing this book nearly impossible. I'll consider this strategy for the 2025 book.

I don't know any other tech book that I have enjoyed as much. A highly rewarding read.

A thank you to the reading club from discord with whom I read the book.
