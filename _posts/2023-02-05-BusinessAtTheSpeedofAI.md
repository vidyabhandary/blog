## Business at the Speed of AI

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vidyabhandary/blog/master/images/BusinessAtTheSpeedofAI.png)

Today, Artificial Intelligence(AI) plays a crucial role in shaping our online experiences, often driving them.

- **When we publish posts on LinkedIn, share blog articles, or tweet, AI algorithms review them along with the hashtags and may reshare, retweet, or add them to relevant newsfeeds.**

- **Financial trading bots may act on news published by reputable financial outlets regarding a company's results.**

- **Perhaps the financial article may have been written, assisted by a language model like ChatGPT, just like business proposals, formal and informal emails.**

- **AI algorithms generate product recommendations, AI-powered recruitment bots screen job applications, and advertising bots target our social media usage.**

- **Chatbots offer AI-based customer support, Dall-E creates product images, and AI is winning art competitions.**

## The reality of an **AI-based neuralink** is already here, and it is conceivably not incorrect to say; **business is conducted at the speed of AI**, not speed of human interactions.
