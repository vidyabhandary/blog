### Storytelling with Data: A Data Visualization Guide for Business Professionals - Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic

It is now accepted that a well designed graph / image / infographic can has a tremendous power to communicate.

**What I really liked about this book was the lack of fluff. To the point, concise and exactly how much was needed.**

Too many books end up clutterring their message when they aim at a predefined number of pages. 

Many good examples with step by step instructions on what exactly is wrong with the infographic and how it can be improved and the final improved version.

The only drawback I would say is that, only basic graph / charts are considered. One does not get to go beyond basics.
