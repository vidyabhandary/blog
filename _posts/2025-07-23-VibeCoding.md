Watched the origin of the [VIBE coding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw) and some of the ways to use LLMs from Andrej Karpathy!

🎮 **VIBE Coding** – AI-assisted coding where you guide ChatGPT while it writes live code.

1️⃣ If ChatGPT were to introduce itself?
- 🤖 I am ChatGPT—I am a 1TB zip file.
- 🔹 My knowledge comes from pretraining on the internet (but I only vaguely remember things from ~6 months ago). 
- 🔹 My style and responses are shaped by post-training with human labelers at OpenAI. 
- 🔹 I don’t recall facts perfectly—I generate responses based on probability. 

📌 Think of LLMs as probabilistic, statistical recollection of the internet, not an exact memory. 

2️⃣ How to Use LLMs More Effectively 
- ✅ Start fresh with a new chat when switching topics—each session creates a new working memory. 
- ✅ Avoid cluttering the memory—irrelevant data can affect response quality. 
- ✅ Know your model – Different LLMs have different strengths: 
 > Reasoning models (GPT-4 o-series, Claude Sonnet) analyze deeply—great for math, code, and structured thinking. 

> General models are not reasoning models but can still figure out complex problems. 

3️⃣ Tools That Supercharge Your ChatGPT Experience
- 🔍 Internet Search – Stops relying on outdated training data & fetches fresh, real-time info. 
- 📑 File Uploads – Upload PDFs & ask specific questions. 
- 📚 LLM-assisted reading – Don't just read alone; use ChatGPT to clarify doubts in real time for better retention. 
- 📊 Code Interpreter – Great for math & data analysis (but verify AI-generated code; it can sneak in errors!). 

4️⃣ Next-Level AI Capabilities 
- 📱 Claude Artifacts – Instantly generate & deploy personal apps (like a flashcard app) from a single prompt. 
- 🖼 Diagram Generation – Conceptual maps for books, chapters, source codes. 
- 💻 Cursor Composer – Autonomous context-based coding assistant that can edit across multiple files. 
- And of course "Vibe coding" !

5️⃣ Multimodal AI – Going Beyond Text
- 🎙 True Audio Understanding – LLMs now process audio chunks directly, without converting to text. 
- 🎥 Images & OCR – Extracts text from images, deciphers memes, and explains visuals. 
- 🎧 Podcast Generation – Create on-demand AI-generated podcasts tailored to your interests. 
- 📹 AI Video Input & Output – Future-ready tools like Sora generate videos from AI. 

6️⃣ AI Productivity & Personalization Hacks
- 🧠 Memory Feature – ChatGPT remembers details about you (sometimes updates automatically, but sometimes you must ask explicitly). 
- ⚙️ Custom Instructions – Personalize how ChatGPT responds based on your preferences. 
- 🔄 Custom GPTs – Perfect for repetitive tasks or specific workflows
