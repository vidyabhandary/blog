**mCP (Model Context Protocol)** is an open protocol that **standardizes how AI applications connect with external tools and data sources**. Think of it as the API layer for AI agents , enabling seamless interaction with databases, APIs, and more.

Key points:
• **Unified Connectivity**: mCP simplifies how AI accesses real-time data, ensuring consistency and efficiency.
• **Enhanced AI Capabilities**: It allows for richer, more comprehensive AI-driven applications, like personalized travel planning (as the video example showed!).
• **pen Standard**: Fosters collaboration and innovation by providing a framework for developers to build upon.

Example Usage: **AI Travel Agent**:
 • The mCP client (travel booking website/app) takes user requests and uses a large language model (LLM). The client connects to various mCP servers for flight, hotel, weather, and attraction information. 
•   The LLM processes the request and gets necessary details from the mCP servers. 
•   The standardized format allows the client to easily retrieve and package information, responding to the user with a comprehensive plan. 

Benefits of mCP:
1.   Provides real-time data in a standardized format 
2.   Enables comprehensive planning 
3.   Offers adaptability and extensibility for adding new features
